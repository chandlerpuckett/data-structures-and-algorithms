# Challenge Summary
Without using built in Java methods write a breadth first algorithm to traverse
a Binary Tree

[Code](../../../../../challenge401/src/main/java/datastructures/tree/BinaryTree.java) |
[Tests](../../../../../challenge401/src/test/java/datastructures/BinaryTreeBreadthFirstTest.java)

## Challenge Description
Expanding on the Binary Tree class, implement a method that uses a "breadth-first" approach
to traversing a Binary Tree & returning an array of values.

## Approach & Efficiency
Iterative approach using a Queue.

- Time: O(h)
- Space: O(n)

## Solution
