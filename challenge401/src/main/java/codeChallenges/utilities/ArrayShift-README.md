# Challenge Summary
This function takes in an array, and a value to be added to the array.
It returns a new array with the value added at the middle index.

## Challenge Description
Given an array of Ints, we have to figure out how to find the middle of the array,
create a new array with enough space to accommodate the existing values as well as the new one
, and insert the new value into the middle of the new array.

## Approach & Efficiency
Because the challenge explicitly instructed us not to use array methods, we used a for loop and
conditional statements to determine the midpoint & create a new array. 

- Efficiency: O(n)
- Space: O(1)
