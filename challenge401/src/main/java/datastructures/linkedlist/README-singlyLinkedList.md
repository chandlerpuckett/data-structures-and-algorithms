# Singly Linked List
This challenge creates a singly linked list

## Challenge
This challenge creates a singly linked list with the methods: insert, includes, and toString.
The insert method inserts an int value at the head of the list.
The includes method checks the list for a value and returns a boolean value. And
the toString method properly formats the output of a singly linked list.

## Approach & Efficiency
Insert Time : O(1)
Insert Space : O(n)

## API
insert -> inserts method at the head of a list
includes -> checks the list for a value & returns True or False
toString -> formats the string output of a list
