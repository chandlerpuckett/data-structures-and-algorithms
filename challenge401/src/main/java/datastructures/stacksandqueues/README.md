# Stacks and Queues
Building Stack and Queue datastructures with various classes and methods

#### Stack
[Code](Stack.java) | [Tests](../../../../../../challenge401/src/test/java/datastructures/StackTest.java)

#### Queue
[Code](Queue.java) | [Tests](../../../../../../challenge401/src/test/java/datastructures/QueueTest.java)

## Challenge
Implementing Stacks & Queues Data Structure

## Approach & Efficiency
Most of the mutator methods have an efficiency of <br>
Time: **O(1)** <br>
Space **O(n)**

## API Methods
Stack:
- [x] `push` 
- [x] `pop`
- [x] `peek`
- [x] `isEmpty`

Queue: 
- [x] `enQueue`
- [x] `deQueue`
- [x] `peek`
- [x] `isEmpty`
